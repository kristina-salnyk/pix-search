# PixSearch

This is a project that enables users to search for images using keywords. Each image in the search results provides information such as likes, views, comments, and downloads. Users can open each image in a preview mode and view them as a slideshow. The images are displayed paginated, and a new set of images is loaded when scrolling.

The project incorporates lazy loading to optimize performance by only loading images as needed. The technologies used in the development of PixSearch include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, along with libraries and tools such as SimpleLightBox, Notiflix, Parcel, Handlebars, Lazysizes, and Axios.
